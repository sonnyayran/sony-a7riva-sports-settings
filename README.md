Setting for shooting sports for the Sony A7RIVA.

| Setting Name  | Setting | Comments                                   |
| --------------|---------| ----------------------------------------------- |
| Aperture      | 2.8     | Keep low to isolate your subject in image. |
| ISO           | Auto    | Set ISO range 100 to 1600. Anything over 1600 introduces very noticable grain in image. |
| Shutter Speed | > 1000  | Be sure to account for camera shake even if you have IBIS (>= 2 x focal length).
